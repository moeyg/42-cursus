# âœ² Introduction

##### _The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured"._

##### _A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale._

##### _Now, itâ€™s your turn to generate some magnificent fractals!_

<br>

# âœ² Objectives

##### _Now that you took over your first graphical library: the `miniLibX`, itâ€™s time for you to light all the pixels of your screen at the same time!_

##### _This new project will be the opportunity for you to hone your `miniLibX` skills, to make you discover/use the mathematical notion of `complex numbers` and to take a peek at the concept of `optimization` in computer graphics._

<br>

# âœ² General Instructions

- ##### _This project will be corrected by humans only. So, feel free to organize and name your files as you wish, but within the constraints listed here._

- ##### _You cannot use global variables._

- ##### _You must code in C._

- ##### _Your project must follow `the Norm`._

- ##### _You have to handle errors carefully. In no way can your program quit unexpectedly (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc)._

- ##### _Your program cannot have memory leaks._

- ##### _You must use the `miniLibX`. Either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above._

<br>

##### _This projectâ€™s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a fractal is._

##### _The constraints are as follows:_

- ##### _Your software should offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set._

- ##### _The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer). This is the very principle of fractals._

- ##### _You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. Itâ€™s even better if you hack away on psychedelic effects._

- ##### _A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly._

- ##### _More parameters must be used for fractal parameters or ignored._

- ##### _You must be able to create different Julia set with the parameters of the program._

##### _As for the graphic representation:_

- ##### _ESC will exit the program._

- ##### _The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended._

<br>

# âœ² Bonus part

##### _Here are some interesting ideas for the bonuses._

- ##### _One more different fractal (there are more than a hundred different types of fractals referenced online)._

- ##### _The zoom follows the actual mouse position._

- ##### _In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows._

- ##### _Make the color range shift._
